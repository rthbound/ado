# Ado

Ado is an affectionate acronym for an app that's basically "A Doings Organizer"

I created this for my family to keep up on household tasks -- things that need doing.

The main idea is you provide a list of things, specify how often each thing should be done, and then tell the app when you do the things.

The things are sorted such that the most overdue (or soonest to be due) items appear first in the list.

No notifications, no reminders, not yet. The tasks (Things) are currently not assigned to anyone, but we are recording which user is doing the Doings when the Things get done.

We'll continue tweaking, adding features, and improving the designs over time.

# Registration

Registration is currently disabled -- the app I've deployed is just for my wife and I. You can see its gawgeous login page here: https://www.ado.life

If you'd like to use it, you can run it on localhost or fork and deploy it for yourselves. It should be trivial to deploy on heroku for free (just disable "force_ssl" in config/environments/production.rb).
